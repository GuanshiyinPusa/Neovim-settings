# Neovim-settings
GuanshiyinPusa Neovim settings.

This config uses NVchad.
I made minor changes to it.
options.lua is straight copy paste from my main branch.
Add copilot.lua and copilot-cmp.lua -- Very good plugin~

I code C,CPP, Pytho. Use Markdown and text for note taking.

the only thing i wanna complain about is nvimtree's keymap is diff from neotree, but i will get used to it. EZ
